</div>

<p class="right fs130"><span style="padding-right: 2em">and Its Environs</span></p>

<p>Well, here we are, standing on the top of a huge pile of concrete
129 feet above the ground floor, about seven miles from the center of
Chattanooga.</p>

<p>What a beautiful body of water it is that spreads before us to the
east! It is a lovely creation. I think you will agree that its shoreline
warrants its claim to as much beauty as the water itself. Really, I
find it so inviting that I would like to join you in a hike all the way
along its many little peninsulas, capes, inlets and tiny bays, halting
long enough to see the loveliest wild flowers, vines, trees and birds,
especially the waterfowls which have been attracted here chiefly because
they find good fishing. Suppose we pause a moment and do a
little figuring. If we should walk twenty miles each day, it would
take us forty days to walk around the shoreline of this lake. On our
way up the river, fifty-nine miles from here, we would walk directly
into the Watts Bar Dam. There we would cross over to descend the
east side of the Chickamauga Lake. While we were at Watts Bar
Dam, surely some person would tell us that seventy-two miles farther
upstream is the Fort Loudon Dam, whose waters back up as far as
Knoxville, Tennessee, a city that is 650 miles from where the Tennessee
empties into the Ohio. By the time we had walked back to our
starting point, we would have trekked 810 miles.</p>

<p>If the water that is now passing by could talk so we could understand,
some of it would tell us that it has come from storage dams
that have been built on the tributaries of the Tennessee River. The
dams thus reporting would be, Hiwassee, Norris, Fontana, Cherokee,
Douglas, Ocoee, Apalachia and Chatuge. The TVA also has control
of the water of the following five dams of the Aluminum Company of
America: Calderwood, Cheoah, Glenville, Nantahala, and Santeetlah.</p>

<p>What do you really see here? Briefly, there are a navigation lock 60
by 360 feet, a concrete spillway, a concrete powerhouse intake section, a
concrete bulkhead section, and an earth embankment on each side.
It calls for a long stretch of the legs to walk from one end to the
other. The spillway section which includes eighteen piers, is 864 feet
long. The eighteen gates are forty feet wide and forty feet high. The
earth embankment to our left on the north side, is 1,390 feet in length;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
the embankment on our right, or south side, is 3,000 feet long. The
total length is approximately 5,800 feet or a little more than a mile.</p>

<p>The spillway section has a width of eighty-two feet at its base.
Including the apron, its width increases to a hundred and twenty-five
feet. The power station with its three units has a generating capacity
of 81,000 kilowatts. There are three hydraulic turbines, and one more
can be added.</p>

<p>The Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, passed by Congress,
gave power to the board to construct dams in the Tennessee
River. Accordingly, the TVA began work on the Chickamauga Dam,
January 13, 1936. The project was finished January 31, 1941, or five
years after the work was started. The filling of the reservoir was
begun January 15, 1940. In that time 2,510,800 cubic yards of earth
were handled and 491,800 cubic yards of concrete poured. The total
cost of constructing the Chickamauga Dam, including the cost of acquiring
all the lands, totaled thirty-eight million dollars.</p>

<p>It is well to remember that the water shed of the Tennessee River
embraces 40,910 square miles. Believe it or not, about half of that
area is found above the Chickamauga Dam. This upper basin has an
average rainfall of 50.8 inches.</p>


<h2>LOOKING WESTWARD</h2>

<p>Let us now turn our backs to the Chickamauga Lake for a glimpse
towards the west. To the southwest, we see Lookout Mountain standing
like a bright cameo in a position as if it were looking down on
Chattanooga. To our right, we view the head of another rocky monster
that is looking southward. This is Signal Mountain, which is
simply the local name for the southern end of Waldens Ridge. A
little to our left, in the background between Signal and Lookout
Mountains, stands Raccoon Mountain. These are parts of the Cumberlands
and are plateaus, each of them being quite flat on its top.
Their average altitude is approximately 2,000 feet above the sea. The
Cumberlands were so named by Dr. Thomas Walker in 1748 in honor
of the Duke of Cumberland, William Augustus, who two years previous
had defeated the Scotch in the battle of Culloden. Following
that bloody event, the Duke was so bitterly hated that the early Scotch
settlers in America refused to call the mountains by the name <em>Cumberland</em>,
preferring to speak of them by their Cherokee name <em>Ouisoto
Mountains</em>, (pronounced We-soto).</p>

<p>If we could leap like a giant kangaroo, the first kick of our hind
legs down the Tennessee River would leave us standing on the dam
at Hales Bar, forty miles from here. Another leap of eighty-two miles
and we would rest on Guntersville Dam in Alabama. Our third leap
would take us seventy-four miles farther on where we would strike the
Wheeler Dam. Next a kitten’s spring of only sixteen miles and we
would strike the Wilson Dam. A sudden jump of 52 miles would
leave us astride the Pickwick Dam, and then a tremendous long leap
of 184 miles and we would find ourselves perched on the Kentucky
Dam, only twenty-three miles from the mouth of the Tennessee River
at Paducah, Kentucky. If we chose to continue the journey to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
mouth of the river we would find ourselves 471 miles from where we
now stand on the Chickamauga Dam.</p>

<br>

<p>The high railroad bridge we see directly in front of us is where
the Cincinnati-Chattanooga division of the Southern Railway crosses
the river. This railroad is owned by the city of Cincinnati and leased
by the Southern Railway. The creek a few rods to our right is the
North Chickamauga. It has its source on Waldens Ridge and leaves
the mountain about fifteen miles from here at Daisy, Tennessee, where
it has chiseled out a marvelously beautiful gulch of rustic beauty.
When the Chickamauga Dam was begun, this creek emptied into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
river a short distance above the dam, but after an artificial bed was
dug, its course was changed so that it would find the river below the
dam.</p>

<p>To our left, on the south side, we can see where the South Chickamauga
Creek empties into the Tennessee. It was there that the
Federal troops under General W. T. Sherman crossed on pontoon
bridges at daylight, November 24, 1863. The steamer <em>Dunbar</em> assisted
in transporting Sherman’s division to the other side of the river.
A pontoon was also laid across the mouth of the Chickamauga. It
was then that Sherman attacked the right wing of General Bragg’s
Confederate forces, which occupied Missionary Ridge from this north
end to the south. Sherman was fighting throughout the day while the
battle of Lookout Mountain was raging to our southwest. Because
Missionary Ridge ends near the Chickamauga Dam, and since the
battle fought there on November 25, 1863, has been regarded by some
historians as the turning point in the Civil War, a little later I shall
describe briefly that battle. For the present we shall leave some of
the interesting places below the dam in order to tell about a few sites
and historical events that took place above the dam and along the
South Chickamauga Creek.</p>


<h2>DALLAS AND DALLAS ISLAND</h2>

<p>The waters that gather above the Chickamauga Dam have quite
naturally obliterated some old village sites and some prehistoric
mounds. It was fortunate, however, that the Department of Archaeology,
under the direction of T. M. N. Lewis, of the University of
Tennessee, made scientific explorations of the ancient dwelling places
and the mounds. The facts and the artifacts thus obtained have been
preserved for posterity.</p>

<p>On February 26, 1940, when the navigation lock at the Chickamauga
Dam was opened, since there was no Cherokee Indian to represent
the aborigines who used the Tennessee to make the initial trip
through it, it was a fortunate circumstance that Nature stepped in
and saved the day on that memorable occasion and let a large turtle
swim through. It was a splendid model for a river boat, somewhat
made on the order of a submarine, a natural boat propelled by living
paddles and guided by a live rudder. It passed through the lock as
freely as if it had been commissioned to serve as the official representative
of the river’s inhabitants.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Among the historical places blotted out by waters of Chickamauga
Dam was Oo-le-quah, or Dallas Island, situated a few miles upstream.
On the higher ground overlooking the isle was the village of Dallas,
which, in 1819, became the seat of government at the time Hamilton
County, in which the Chickamauga Dam is situated, was carved out
of the Hiwassee Purchase. The new county’s south boundary at that
date was the Tennessee River, which up to about the year 1800, had
been known to the Indians as the Hogohegee River. The Cherokees
still remained in possession of the land south of the river.</p>


<h2>HARRISON</h2>

<p>When the state of Georgia, by force, took possession of the Cherokee
lands within her borders, some of the prominent Indians sought
refuge in Tennessee. Among those who were chased out of Georgia
was Joseph Vann of Spring Place, a dozen miles east of Dalton.
James Vann, the father of Joseph, had married a full-blooded Cherokee.
He was a prosperous farmer. The two and a half-story brick
residence he erected about the year 1797 still stands at Spring Place
and has been tenanted through the years. It is looked on today as a
splendid example of early architecture.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">An old boatman on the Tennessee River operating his hand-propelled
paddle wheel boat.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>After leaving Georgia, Joseph Vann settled on the south bank of
the Tennessee River, a few miles above the Chickamauga Dam. He
was very industrious, and soon there were thirty-five houses erected
and occupied on his property. The village was known as Vanntown.
There was scarcely a moment’s rest, however, for the poor Indians.
The greedy whites kept encroaching on their real estate until only a
small portion of their once large territory remained. Several years
previously the government had induced some of the Cherokees to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>move to the Arkansas, west of the Mississippi. The last of the Cherokees
departed in 1838. At that time the white settlers took possession
of the lands lying south of the Tennessee River. Three years previous
to that date, however, the whites had slowly been slipping into
their lands. Hamilton County’s boundary was then extended to take
in the Cherokee lands from the Tennessee River to the Georgia line.
It was at that time that Dallas lost the county seat, since Vanntown
was chosen and a court house was erected. This happened about the
time that William H. Harrison was elected President of the United
States, so Vanntown became Harrison, Tennessee.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>About the year 1815, following the close of the Creek War, John
Ross, Cherokee, and Timothy Meigs, son of Return J. Meigs, the
Indian Agent, established a trading post seven miles south of the
Chickamauga Dam. They operated a ferry as well as a general store.
The place became known as Ross’ Landing, but when the Indians had
departed for the lands in the West, the whites had the town surveyed,
and the name was changed to <em>Chattanooga</em>. John P. Long became the
first postmaster, March 22, 1837. However, this was not the first post
office established in the old Cherokee lands, for on April 5, 1817, Rossville
post office was established four miles to the south with John Ross
as postmaster. This was said to have been the first post office established
in this part of the Cherokee Nation.</p>

<p>The word <em>Chattanooga</em> is a corruption in the spelling of the
Muskogean word <em>Chatanugi</em>, which years previously had been the
name of Lookout Mountain, meaning “rock coming to a point.” In
the narrow valley between the east side of Lookout Mountain and
Missionary Ridge is a small stream which was also known as <em>Chatanugi
Creek</em>. Near its mouth where it empties into the Tennessee was,
in the 18th century, a small Indian village by the same name.</p>

<p>It is an interesting geological fact that in ages past the water we
now know as the Tennessee River flowed south of the east base of
Lookout Mountain and emptied into the Coosa River in what is now
Alabama. A later upheaval blocked its southern passage and forced
it to seek a new route, which it did by cutting out its way through
the rough rocks of the Cumberlands.</p>

<p>The town of Chattanooga kept growing and was chosen as the
county seat. Harrison, which for many years had been full of promise
for growing into a large and thriving city, began to dwindle until it was
left behind as an ordinary village, which was wiped off of the map
by the waters after the building of the Chickamauga Dam. The forming
of the Chickamauga Lake created so many beautiful sites along
its margin that hundreds of families could not resist the advantages
offered by the board of the TVA to take up sites for summer homes
and camps. At various places on the lake are to be found beautiful
cottages and bungalows where families enjoy recreation as well as
the pure atmosphere and the cool currents of air that come from the
fresh waters. There they enjoy boating, fishing and other sports, not
only along the shores of Harrison Bay State Park, but also at Soddy
and other choice situations. When the town of Harrison was obliterated
by the impounded waters of Chickamauga Lake, there came into
existence new Harrison, whose people today enjoy boating and fishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
where Joseph Vann and other Cherokees once produced crops of
hay and corn.</p>


<h2>HIWASSEE ISLAND</h2>

<p>A few miles upstream from the obliterated Dallas Island there
was located until the completion of the Chickamauga Dam, the second
largest island in the Tennessee River. This was Hiwassee Island,
which contained 781 acres, was two miles long, and a mile wide. It
received its name from the Hiwassee River, which finds the Tennessee
east of the island.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1937 and continuing for two consecutive years the
Archaelogical Department of the University of Tennessee succeeded
in completing the excavations of all village sites and mounds on this
historical island. The result of these investigations were published in
1946 by the University Press, Knoxville, in a book entitled the <em>Hiwassee
Island</em>, by T. M. N. Lewis and Madeline Kneberg.</p>

<p>When the white settlers came into Tennessee, they found Hiwassee
Island was being ruled by the honest and kind-hearted Cherokee
Chief Oolooteeskee, popularly known as John Jolly. In 1809,
when Sam Houston was 16 years old, he visited Hiwassee Island.
Chief Jolly became so fond of the lad that he adopted him, rechristening
him <em>The Raven</em>.</p>

<p>Several years previous, Jolly’s brother, Tahkinsteeska, had moved
to Arkansas and was the principal chief of the Cherokees in the West.
In 1818, John Jolly decided to join his brother. Although agents of
the United States had been persuading the Cherokee to move to the
new lands west of the Mississippi, it was necessary that when they
chose to do so they must obtain a permit to make the change, as indicated
in the following official paper:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“John Jolly, the bearer, having under his superintendence 16
boats laden with Cherokee families and their property are on their
way to the Arkansas River to enter lands designated for them by the
Treaty in July last, in exchange for lands here relinquished by them
to the United States, which Treaty was constitutionally ratified the
25th of December, 1817. The said Cherokee Nation being at peace
and friendship with the United States, are entitled to the confidence
and friendly offices of the citizens, and therefore recommended to all
such with whom they may meet on their passage to the place of their
destination. They are hereby particularly recommended for aid
(should their circumstances need it) to the officers commanding military
posts, or stations on their line of movement.</p>

<p>“Given under my hand and seal of the Cherokee Agency the
26th day of January, 1818, and in the 43rd year of American Liberty
and Independence.”</p>

<div>
 <p class="no-indent" style="float: left;">(SEAL)</p>
 <p style="float: right;">RETURN J. MEIGS.</p>
</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>

<p>Sam Houston, however, did not go with his foster-father on this
long journey. He remained in Tennessee and studied law. A few
years later, Houston was elected governor of Tennessee. Not long
thereafter he married a Miss Allen of Nashville, Tennessee, and in
three months he left her and resigned as governor. Houston then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
sought his old friend and foster-father on the Arkansas River and
married Chief Jolly’s niece, a Cherokee by the name of Tiana Rogers.
Houston’s next move took him to Texas where he became commander-in-chief
of the Texan army. After defeating Santa Ana in April, 1836,
thereby winning the independence of Texas, Houston became the first
president of the republic of Texas. It was due to his negotiations that
Texas was annexed by the United States in 1845. The flooding of
the Hiwassee Island by the waters of the Chickamauga Dam put an
end to its history as a place where human beings might reside.</p>

<p>If we could have stood on the bank of the river here almost 200
years ago, we would have been amazed at the sight of the curious
kinds of watercraft floating by. Perhaps, the most primitive type
would have been the bullboat, which was made by stretching a wet
buffalo hide with hair on the inside over a framework of willow strips,
in the shape of a tub or a canoe, about seven feet in diameter. The
bowl-shaped type would carry about 700 pounds. It was propelled
with a paddle made of wood, or with the shoulder blade of a buffalo
fastened to a stick for a handle.</p>

<p>Every now and then would have passed us a big flat boat resembling
in shape a big box floating on the water, carrying as its cargo human
families with their possessions. This rather frail boat was known as
an ark, because it suggested the Biblical boat made by Noah. The
ark served the early American settler so well that one writer at least
has aptly asserted that “it was out of the womb of an ark that our
nation was born.”</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_13" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>We would have been well entertained by the frequent passing of
the flatboats. The average rivercraft of this sort would carry about
400 barrels of goods. About two-thirds of the flatboat was roofed like
an ordinary house to keep families and cargo dry.</p>

<p>There also would have been seen many popular keelboats. Compared
to the boxlike ark, the keelboat was graceful, long and slender,
ranging in length from forty to eighty feet, sharp at each end and
with a shallow keel. Most of the keelboats were well roofed. Sometimes
a sail was hoisted to aid the crew in the difficult task of rowing
the boat.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>We would have seen some barges, too. The average length of
this kind of boat was from fifty to one hundred twenty feet with a
width from twelve to twenty feet. A cabin was built at the stern, and
fastened to the one or two masts were square sails.</p>

<br>

<p>Besides the light canoes, we would have noticed the passing of
the dug-out, known as a pirogue. A boat of this kind was made by
hollowing out a log of cottonwood, tulip, sycamore or other tree with
an adz or by fire. One or both ends were left square. A very large
pirogue would have passed which was made by chopping out two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>large trees, and using one tree for each side of the boat, filling in the
middle with planks, and then sealing the bottom so that it was watertight.
Such a boat would carry several tons of produce and as many
as twenty-five men.</p>

<p>There would be passing a few flattened boats with tapering ends
known as bateaux. A bateau was not as clumsy as the pirogue to
handle in the water. The very light bateau was known as a skiff.
The sizes of the bateaux varied, and each of the larger kinds used on
the river was able to carry fifty tons of cargo.</p>


<h2>BATTLE OF MISSIONARY RIDGE</h2>

<p>I shall now resume the story of the Battle of Missionary Ridge, a
brief reference to it having been previously made when General Sherman’s
crossing the river near this point was mentioned. On September
19 and 20, 1863, the Federals in command of General Rosecrans
had suffered a defeat at the battle of Chickamauga, in which a total
of about 34,000 men were killed and wounded, the casualties being
about evenly divided. In the battle of Lookout Mountain, November
24, the Confederates suffered severe losses, including that strategic
point. During that night the Confederates withdrew their forces to
Missionary Ridge where they joined General Bragg’s troops. Throughout
the day of the battle of Lookout Mountain Sherman persisted in
pounding at Bragg’s right wing, the object being to force him to
weaken his center by strengthening his right wing. If this had happened,
General Grant, then stationed on Orchard Knob, a few miles
south of this dam, would have struck a heavy blow to Bragg’s center
and split the Confederates in two, making their capture a certainty.
This was November 25th. At 2:30 o’clock in the afternoon the Federals
were in battleline facing Missionary Ridge and were waiting
patiently for official orders to attack. Notice was given them to be
ready to advance at a signal of the firing of six cannons two seconds
apart from Orchard Knob.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Eight sail boats racing on Chickamauga Lake</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Impatient soldiers anxiously counted the minutes waiting for the
booming of the six cannons. The thrill came promptly at 3 o’clock,
when the noise of the half dozen cannons startled their ears. With a
wild rush, even though they were under terrific fire from Bragg’s army
on Missionary Ridge, the Union soldiers succeeded in driving the
Confederates from the first line of trenches. There they had been
ordered to halt and wait for further orders. After a moment’s pause,
as if for the purpose of gaining a deep breath, there was a roar and
shout from thousands of throats along the entire Federal line, as the
troops plunged forward without official orders from commanding officers.
In the next few moments there was made one of the most remarkable
charges that was ever recorded in military history. Just
as General Hooker’s troops had the previous day enthusiastically
stormed the Confederates stationed on the slopes of Lookout Mountain,
so on the following day, did the Federal army under Grant
sweep up the western slopes of Missionary Ridge, taking the advance
line of the Confederates before them. Because of the nearness of the
two contending forces the Confederate batteries stationed on the crest
of the ridge could not be used. The Union men moved forward yelling
as they fired their muskets, whereupon Bragg’s line broke in wild
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>confusion and was swept entirely from Missionary Ridge’s full length,
except a small section near the railroad tunnel at the north end.
Bragg’s men fled eastward and the Union troops pursued them as far
as the Georgia line. The Confederates lost forty cannon, 7,000 stand
of arms, and 6,687 men. The Federals lost 5,815 men. The battle
of Missionary Ridge was so closely connected with that of Lookout
Mountain, some students of military history at least think of it as the
second day’s battle of Lookout Mountain.</p>


<h2>CHICKAMAUGA</h2>

<p>John P. Long, Chattanooga’s first postmaster, who lived among
the Cherokees, stated that the meaning of the word <em>Chickamauga</em> is
“sluggish water.” J. P. Brown, however, in his book entitled <cite>Old
Frontiers</cite> says the word means “dwelling place of the war chief.” The
Chickamauga Dam was so named because of its being situated near
the mouth of the North and South Chickamauga Creeks. In the early
days of the Indians’ occupancy of this territory there was a village at
the mouth of the South Chickamauga known as <em>Bulltown</em>.</p>

<p>About eighty miles northeast of the Chickamauga Dam, in the
Little Tennessee River near old Fort Loudon, was Mialoquo, a very
prominent island where lived many prominent Cherokees. Dragging
Canoe was the leader of the militant minded Indians there.</p>

<p>In 1770 there passed down the Tennessee River at the site of the
Chickamauga Dam a Scotch trader by the name of John McDonald.
With him was a half-breed Cherokee by the name of William Shorey.
They turned their boats which held their possessions up the South
Chickamauga Creek and paddled and poled for about seven miles upstream,
halting at the crossing of the Great War Path where the Lee
Highway now crosses the Chickamauga Creek.</p>

<p>At this point, John McDonald decided to establish a trading post.
The old Scotchman soon proved himself a good business man because
he became very prosperous. At the outbreak of the American Revolution
the Cherokees aligned themselves on the side of the British.
McDonald was appointed the sub-agent for the King’s service, and his
place was the headquarters for Tories and Indians south of the Ohio
River.</p>

<p>John McDonald married Anna Shorey, daughter of William
Shorey. The location of his home and store is now the site of the
Brainerd Mission, which was established in later years. Directly across
the Chickamauga from McDonald’s was Chickamauga Town, that
stretched a mile on the higher ground, ending at the present Chattanooga
Airport. In 1849, when the state of Georgia finished the Western
and Atlantic Railroad, a station and post office was established
there known as Chickamauga, Tennessee. It became a busy village
where thousands of dollars worth of farm produce was bought and
shipped. After General Bragg abandoned Chattanooga, Chickamauga
became the terminus where the Confederate troops and supplies were
loaded and unloaded.</p>

<p>In 1777 the Cherokee settlements from Virginia to the Chattahoochee
River were destroyed by the whites. Following these heavy
losses, the Lower Cherokees gave up all their lands lying in South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
Carolina, except a very small strip on their western boundary. Two
months later, the Middle and Upper Cherokees signed away their
lands lying east of the Blue Ridge. About the same time they ceded
their lands in northeast Tennessee to the white man. Most of the
Cherokees, feeling helpless, accepted the unjust treatment, but the
loss of their most valuable ground was more than Dragging Canoe
could endure. This patriotic Cherokee declared that before he would
submit to such an outrageous treaty, which swindled his people boldly,
he would go to war. There were hundreds of other brave Indians
who felt as did Dragging Canoe and were awaiting an opportunity to
strike back at the greedy whites, hoping thereby to regain some of
their lost property. When Dragging Canoe made his intentions known,
there were attracted to him the bravest of his tribe, who seceded from
the Cherokee, organizing themselves into a militant wing which became
known as the Chickamaugas. They settled at various places
on the Chickamauga Creek.</p>

<p>This beautiful stream of water is formed by the aquatic contributions
of many other creeks. It rises in northwest Georgia, and as
it flows northwest it collects the waters from other sources. One mile
above the site of John McDonald’s trading post it receives the water
from the West Chickamauga, which has its source at the junction of
Pigeon and Lookout Mountains, thirty-five miles south of Chattanooga.
This is the Chickamauga Creek which gave the name to the
battle of Chickamauga. It might properly be stated here that the
many references to it in Civil War history as meaning “the river of
death” is an error.</p>

<p>Henry Hamilton, British Governor of the Northwest Territory,
stationed at Detroit, had transported on horseback from Pensacola
thousands of dollars in army supplies, which were stored at McDonald’s
for the Cherokees to use in their warfare against the Americans.
Hamilton had offered so many rewards to the Indians for the scalps
of revolutionists that he was popularly dubbed the <em>Hair Buyer</em>. John
Stuart was the British Agent for the South who had charge of seeing
that the war supplies were kept at McDonald’s. Everything went well
until the Americans, in command of Colonels Evan Shelby and Montgomery,
got into boats at Kingsport, Tennessee, in the spring of 1779,
and descended the Tennessee River. Soon after passing where the
Chickamauga Dam now stands, they piloted their boats to the south
side, where they found an Indian fishing. They made a prisoner of
him and forced him to guide them to Chickamauga Town, Dragging
Canoe’s headquarters. On reaching Chickamauga, they took the Indians
by surprise, captured all of the supplies the British had stored
with McDonald, and burnt the buildings to the ground. Among the
spoils were 150 head of horses which the officers employed for riding
back home. Dragging Canoe’s brother, Little Owl, who settled two
miles upstream at the same time Chickamauga Town was selected,
had his village destroyed by Shelby’s men shortly after they had reduced
to ashes the capital of the Chickamaugas. There were many
prominent Cherokees living at Chickamauga Town, among them was
one named Long Fellow, a son of Nancy Ward, the beloved Cherokee
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>woman. Dragging Canoe and Little Owl were first cousins of Nancy
Ward.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Motor boats speeding on Chickamauga Lake</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>In 1785 an Indian trader by the name of Mayberry left Baltimore
with a supply of goods. Daniel Ross, a young man from Sutherlandshire,
Scotland, met Mayberry, and being full of adventure joined
him on the proposed journey south. They took to the Tennessee River
at Kingsport and on their way down stream learned from a Chickasaw
Indian, who was a passenger on the boat, that both Ross and Mayberry
were to be captured. When they landed at Brown’s Ferry, a
short distance below Ross’ Landing, the Indians were suspicious of
the new arrivals. Chief Bloody Fellow asked for an immediate execution,
but before a definite decision was reached, a messenger was
sent to confer with John McDonald at Chickamauga. McDonald was
able to secure the release of the two men. Later, Daniel Ross married
Molly McDonald, daughter of John McDonald, and John Ross,
who later became the most distinguished Chief of the Cherokee Nation,
was their son. Ten miles northeast of Dragging Canoe’s Chickamauga
Town was another Cherokee settlement known as Ooltewah.
Some of the Cherokees most prominent men once lived in that region,
especially along Ooltewah Creek, which name has been corrupted to
Wolf Tever. Much of the land there which was formerly occupied
by the Cherokees, has been inundated by the Chickamauga Dam.
Among the Cherokees once living there was Ostenaco, popularly
known in history as Judd’s Friend.</p>

<p>Following the disgraceful treaty of Long Island, in 1777, Ostenaco
joined the Chickamaugas and moved to Ooltewah. In 1760, when
the British troops surrendered Fort Loudon, Ostenaco was one of the
chiefs to march out with the conquered soldiers. The day’s trek took
the 180 soldiers 15 miles where they encamped on Cane Creek. At
daybreak the next morning the British were attacked by several hundred
Cherokees, and after they had killed Paul Demere, who had been
in command of the fort, and 23 of his men, Ostenaco ran about the
field yelping like a wolf in an effort to stop the Indians from fighting.
He thus saved the lives of many white soldiers.</p>

<p>After the restoration of peace Ostenaco went on a visit to Williamsburg,
Virginia, and there saw a picture of King George III. This
fired his ambition to make a journey to England, as his old friend,
Chief Little Carpenter, had once done. After Ostenaco’s persistent
pleading the governor of Virginia gave his consent. Ostenaco with
two attendants and with William Shorey of Chickamauga as interpreter
set sail with Lieutenant Henry Timberlake as guide. Before
reaching England William Shorey took sick and died. On their arrival
they were presented to King George by Lord Eglinton. The
Indians attracted considerable attention. Sir Joshua Reynolds, eminent
artist, made a group painting of the Indians, and then he made
a separate painting of Ostenaco.</p>

<p>Without an interpreter Ostenaco suffered a serious handicap.
He was unable to deliver an address he had prepared for King George.
He was determined that the King should know what he had to say
and on his return to America, November 3, 1762, he gave the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
address to Governor Bull of Charleston, S. C., to be translated
and transmitted to King George:</p>

<p>“Some time ago, my nation was in darkness, but that darkness
has now cleared up. My people were in great distress, but that is ended.
There will be no more bad talks in my nation, but all will be
good talks. If any Cherokee shall kill an Englishman, that Cherokee
shall be put to death. Our women are bearing children to increase
our nation, and I will order those who are growing up to avoid making
war with the English. If any of our head men retain resentment
against the English for their relations who have been killed, and if
any of them speak a bad word concerning it, I shall deal with them
as I see cause. No more disturbances will be heard in my nation. I
speak not with two tongues, and ashamed of those who do.”</p>

<p>Ostenaco was seasick on his way over the big pond, and the following
brief report hints as to what impressed him most on the long
journey:</p>

<p>“Although I met with a good deal of trouble going over the
wide water, that is more than recompensed by the satisfaction of seeing
the King and the reception I met from him being treated as one of
his children and finding the treatment of every one there good to me.</p>

<p>“The number of warriors and people all of one color which we
saw in England, far exceeded what we thought possibly could be. That
we might see everything which was strange to us, the king gave us a
gentleman to attend to us all the day, and at night till bedtime.</p>

<p>“The head warrior of the canoe who brought us over the wide
water, used us very well. He desired us not to be afraid of the French
for he and his warriors could fight like men, and die rather than be
taken.”</p>

<p>The Chickamaugas were not ready to give up after their towns
had been destroyed in 1779. They rebuilt Chickamauga Town, but
in 1782 John Sevier, in command of a troop of mounted Tennesseeans,
descended on them, and after burning Chickamauga, marched up the
creek and destroyed Little Owl’s village. Fourteen years later John
Sevier became the first governor of Tennessee.</p>

<p>It is of interest to note that the land on which Little Owl’s village
was situated, containing 105 acres, has been The Elise
Chapin Wild Life Sanctuary, owned by the Chattanooga Audubon
Society. On the property is an Indian cabin which, according to
reports and records handed down by the earliest white settlers, was
the birthplace of Spring Frog, or Tooantuh, the Cherokee sportsman
and naturalist. The cabin has been preserved by Mrs. Sarah Key
Patten and is one of the oldest found in this part of the Cherokee
country. Tooantuh was born about the year 1754, fought with Andrew
Jackson in the Creek war, and was praised for his bravery at
the battle of Horseshoe Bend. He went West and took up the life of
a farmer at Briartown, Oklahoma, where he died. He was a man of
great influence and was among the chiefs whose portrait was painted
for the War Department.</p>


<h2>THE BRAINERD MISSION</h2>

<p>I have already acquainted you with John McDonald, Scotch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
trader, and Dragging Canoe’s Chickamauga Town across the creek
from McDonald’s home. Before the removal of the Cherokees there
was more history made at that place, which at the time attracted
visitors from as far away as England, and yet it is in less than 10 miles
of the Chickamauga Dam.</p>

<p>After a hundred years of warfare, not until the year 1800 were
the Cherokees able to rest. That year the Moravians established a
mission at Spring Place, Georgia. Before selecting that place they
visited McDonald’s on the Chickamauga and, after examining it closely,
rejected it because they judged it to be an unhealthy place in which
to live. In 1816, when the American Board of Commissioners for
Foreign Missions, of Boston, sent Cyrus Kingsbury to the Cherokee
country, he purchased the identical place that the Moravians had
rejected. It was directly across the Chickamauga Creek from Chickamauga
Town.</p>

<p>On his way South, Kingsbury stopped in Washington and laid
his plans for establishing a mission and school before President James
Madison, who heartily approved it and tendered government assistance
in equipping it. The school was opened in January 1817 and
had the distinction of being the first school in North America where
domestic science and agriculture were taught. It preceded the Gardiner
Institute of Maine by four years.</p>

<p>The institution grew rapidly. At one time there were forty buildings
of one kind and another standing on its grounds. Some of the
outstanding men and women of New England were its leaders and
teachers. Its first superintendent was Ard Hoyt, who left many prominent
descendants. Hundreds of Cherokees were educated and Christianized
during its twenty-one years of existence.</p>

<p>At first the mission was called <em>Chickamauga</em>, but since Chickamauga
Town was situated on the other side of the creek, visitors coming
to the school often became confused and went to the Indian village.
It was decided to correct the handicap by changing the name
to <em>Brainerd</em>, in honor of David Brainerd, the pioneer missionary among
the Indians of New England and New York. David Brainerd had
been in his grave seventy years before the founding of this namesake
of his.</p>

<p>Many were the visitors of prominence who came to Brainerd.
Perhaps the most noted person was President James Monroe, who
paid the mission a surprise visit May 27, 1819, and spent the night
there. Monroe took a deep interest in the institution and gave it the
material support of the Federal Government.</p>

<p>John Howard Payne, author of the famous song, <cite>Home Sweet
Home</cite>, while collecting data for a history he was preparing of the
Cherokee, spent two weeks at Brainerd, and the fourteen large volumes
of his manuscripts now at the Newberry Library in Chicago contain
copies of many letters written by the pupils of this mission school.</p>

<p>Dr. Samuel Worcester, one of the founders of the American Board
and its first secretary, who was largely responsible for founding Brainerd
Mission, visited the institution in 1821. He was ill when he left
his home in Boston and traveled by boat as far as New Orleans. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
driving a horse and buggy from that southern city to Brainerd, he arrived
there on May 25 a very sick man. On June 7 he passed away.
His funeral in the Brainerd cemetery on June 9, 1821, was attended by
hundreds of Cherokees riding horseback from all parts of the nation,
who came to show their respect for a man they had not seen but whom
all had learned to love.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>Sequoya, the inventor of the Cherokee syllabary, also came for
a visit. The first translations of the Bible in Cherokee was made by
another Indian by the name of <em>Atsi</em>, but who was known to the whites
as John Arch. This took place at Brainerd. John Arch was the interpreter
at Brainerd. When he arrived at the school, after having
walked to the mission from the Nantahala Valley of Western North
Carolina, now a part of the Smoky Mountain Park, he was so raggedly
dressed and so wild looking that the missionaries were three days deciding
whether to accept him as a pupil or not. He had only one
possession, a gun, which he gladly exchanged for some warm clothes.
Much to their surprise John Arch proved an apt pupil, and after
receiving a few years’ education, he became one of the strongest supporters
of the school.</p>

<p>Sequoya spent a dozen years perfecting his alphabet. It was
judged by competent critics as ranking second to the English alphabet,
which required several hundred years to perfect. By Sequoya’s alphabet
of 85 characters a Cherokee was able to read and write in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
few hours. The inventor of this alphabet received many honors. He
had the distinction of being the only literary person in the United
States to receive a pension, which came from the Cherokee Nation.
The Big Trees of California were also named <em>Sequoia</em> in his honor.
His alphabet enabled the Indians to make rapid progress in education,
and after type had been cast in Boston, <cite>The Cherokee Phoenix</cite>,
a newspaper, was established and published at their capitol in New
Echota, near the present town of Calhoun, Georgia. Elias Boudinot,
a full-blooded Cherokee who had been educated at Brainerd Mission
and Cornwall, Connecticut, was chosen as its editor.</p>

<p>John Ross, who became one of the most influential and renowned
Cherokees, was a frequent visitor at Brainerd and was its chief supporter,
so was Andrew Jackson. Jackson was the first white man to
assist Cyrus Kingsbury in his initial meeting with the Cherokees at
Turkeytown near the present town of Centre, Alabama, when the
plan of the mission and school was approved by the Cherokees.</p>

<p>In 1817, Elias Cornelius, representing the American Board, the
founders of the Brainerd Mission, came to Brainerd for a visit. Cornelius
was on a good will tour among the Indians of the South and
Southwest where the Board planned to establish more missions and
schools. On November 15 he left Brainerd on horseback with three
companions <em>en route</em> for New Orleans. After traveling about 200
miles, he reached Caney Creek, which was swollen from recent rains.
Cornelius did not dare risk swimming his horse, but selected a camp
site nearby. Soon he saw a band of Cherokee approaching on the
opposite side of the creek. They plunged their horses into the swollen
stream and swam successfully across. Night was speeding on, and the
Indians encamped in the woods nearby.</p>

<p>In the early part of the evening Cornelius went to pay his neighbors
a friendly visit. On approaching the open fire he saw tomahawks,
corn, skins of wild animals, and bows and arrows spread before
the fire. Fortunately, there was one Indian in the crowd who
was able to speak English. When Cornelius saw the arrows were
bearing the stain of fresh blood, he learned that this band of Cherokees
was returning from west of the Mississippi, some 30 miles from
the Dardanelles, where they had fought a battle with the Osage tribe.
About 800 Cherokees, including their allies, the Delawares and Shawnees,
had participated. Some of the Cherokees had been taken prisoners,
and the Cherokees had captured a few of the Osages. Among
them was a little Osage girl, about five years old, whom they were taking
back to their homes as one of their valued war trophies.</p>

<p>When Cornelius queried them about the little girl’s father and
mother, one of the Indians reached into a rough looking bag, fumbled
around inside, and drew out two human scalps. Holding them up in
plain view he said, “Here they are!”</p>

<p>Cornelius’ heart was deeply touched. He took the little girl in
his arms, whereupon she screamed from fear because she had been
taught to shun white men as being very cruel to Indian children. Remembering
that kindness is the only universal language that is understood
by beasts and birds, by all wild flowers and trees and every living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
thing, Cornelius spoke kindly and sympathetically to the girl and
gave her a piece of sweet cake, which she knew not how to use. Then
he presented her with a pretty cup, and thus he won her confidence
and friendship. Before leaving them, he told the Indians about the
Brainerd Mission, and although the Cherokee who claimed possession
of the little girl intimated that he might be willing to sell her,
he promised faithfully that he would place her in the Brainerd school
on his arrival at the mission. Cornelius learned before leaving them
that the Indian who owned her had not captured her, but that he
had swapped a horse for her with the Cherokee who had taken her
as a prisoner.</p>

<p>The next day Cornelius proceeded on his way. After reaching
Mississippi, while he was entertaining some friends in Natchez, Mr.
Cornelius related the story of the little Osage captive, whereupon a
Mrs. Lydia Carter, who was touched with the pathetic story, gave
Cornelius $150 with which to purchase the little girl’s freedom. Soon
Cornelius received a letter from Brainerd stating that the Indian had
not brought the little girl to the school as he had promised. When
interviewed, the Indian refused to part with her unless the missionaries
would give him in return a Negro girl as a servant. Such thoughts
were repulsive to the missionaries. On Cornelius’ return to Brainerd
he rode 60 miles to call on the Indian who held the little girl. On
seeing him approaching, she did not become frightened, but ran to
greet him. Her owner, however, stubbornly refused to release the
little girl.</p>

<p>On his way back to Boston, Cornelius called on the President of
the United States. Then he interviewed the Secretary of War who
handed him written authority to demand possession of the little Osage
girl. On receipt of the order, Ard Hoyt, superintendent of Brainerd
Mission, went after the little girl and paid the Indian for her release.
On his way back to the Mission, Hoyt, christened her Lydia Carter in
honor of the benevolent woman of Natchez. Lydia was adopted by
Mr. and Mrs. Chamberlain, missionaries at Brainerd, and she became
a sister of their own little daughter, Catherine.</p>

<p>A few days later rumors reached the missionaries that the Cherokees
held two other Osage children, a boy and a girl, and that Lydia
was their sister. The boy had been sold first for $20 and resold so
many times that the last price brought $150. Return J. Meigs, the
Indian Agent, gave the missionaries authority to take possession of
the boy and place him in the Brainerd school. John Ross, then a
dashing young man, went to Brainerd and tendered his services in
rescuing the boy. Ross rode horseback for 250 miles to the mouth of
the Catawba River. He handled the situation with skill. Before going
to the house of the Indian who held the boy, Ross hid his horse
in the woods and stealthily approached on foot. When he glimpsed
the lad, entirely nude, playing about the hut, as agile as a deer, Ross
leaped the fence gracefully, and in another moment he had the boy
securely in his arms. In great excitement the owner came rushing
out. Ross turned a deaf ear to the pleading of the Indian, who tried
all kinds of schemes to prevent Ross from taking the boy away. In a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>few moments Ross had the boy riding behind him on the horse, and
they were hastening on their way to Brainerd Mission. After 13 days,
riding through forests, swimming rivers, fording streams, Ross returned
with his human prize. During this time he had traveled more than
600 miles. On his return the Osage boy was christened John Osage
Ross in honor of the young man who had rescued him.</p>

<p>The story of these two children was so remarkable that Elias
Cornelius wrote a book entitled <cite>The Little Osage Captive</cite>, which was
published in Boston, also in York, England. The book had a wide
sale.</p>

<p>Later when John Rogers, Cherokee, came from Arkansas to take
Lydia Carter and John Osage Ross back to the Osages, there was
great sadness at Brainerd when the missionaries had to part with the
children. John Rogers was an antecedent of the late humorist Will
Rogers and a relative of Tiana Rogers, Sam Houston’s Cherokee wife.</p>

<p>The Brainerd Mission was closed on August 19, 1838, at the time
of the removal of the Cherokees to the West. Many of the missionaries
chose to accompany them to the new lands and there resumed
their labors as they had done so unselfishly at Brainerd. It should be
remembered that Brainerd Mission gave the name to Missionary
Ridge, and on August 19, 1938, at the identical hour marking the
100th anniversary of the closing of the Brainerd Mission, a meeting
was held on the grounds attended by hundreds of Chattanoogans.</p>


<h2>SAVING THE NAME <em>CHICKAMAUGA</em></h2>

<p>A few months before the Chickamauga Dam was completed in
1940, its historical name, with so much beauty and clear, sweet music
in its pronunciation, was threatened with extinction.</p>

<p>Persons who were interested in preserving the original Cherokee
names became anxious over the safety of the name <em>Chickamauga Dam</em>.
Through the columns of <cite>The Chattanooga News</cite> a protest was registered
daily for about a week. The beginning interview came from
the historian of the University of Chattanooga, who was strongly opposed
to changing the name to the <em>McReynolds’ Dam</em>, in honor of
Chattanooga’s Congressman. On succeeding days, similar protests
were published from Chattanooga’s leading citizens, each of them giving
logical reasons for the retention of the name <em>Chickamauga</em>. At
the close of the series of interviews the public had been thoroughly
awakened to the importance of holding on to this beautiful historical
name which had been given to some of this region’s loveliest streams
by its aborigines. Irvin Cobb once declared that the word <em>Chattanooga</em>
was the most beautiful of any word he knew in the English
language. Could not the well known humorist writer also have made
the same assertion about the word Chickamauga?</p>

<p>To climax the movement to hold on to the historical name,
the Chickamauga Chapter of the DAR of Chattanooga, at the last
moment when the bill was up for its final reading, the members voted
unanimously for the retention of the name Chickamauga. When Congressman
S. D. McReynolds received notice of its action, he withdrew
his name, and the name <em>Chickamauga Dam</em> was thereby saved for
posterity.</p>

<h2>CHICKAMAUGA LAKE</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Where farmers’ cattle grazed on pasture lands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fishes feed; the clumsy turtles swim</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where once the corn crops grew; the frog expands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His throat, proud of the pleasure given him;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This lake now slips its fingertips between</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A hundred little pebbled hills, and all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are dressed in tender grass and leaves of green,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With here and there an islet like a ball</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Half sunken in a pool, yet floating on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To reach some distant shore. The swallows swing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their airplanes down and wet their beaks at dawn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And men awake to hear the thrushes sing.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When day grows old and sun is westward bound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They stretch the shadowed trees across the lake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And duck and loon and gull and teal have found</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A place which fishermen will not forsake;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when the moon receives its silvered crown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The waters, like magicians, reach into</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sky and pull the stars and planets down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Without their heat, void of the distant blue;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then leave them floating in their watered graves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And as the boat speeds on, the pilot sees</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amidst the rippled and discordant waves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reflections broken by realities.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This latent power decrees that through the years</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The form of woman shall remain unbowed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By household toil which warped the pioneers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who slaved as sweaty beasts while farmers plowed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tilled the soil; that men shall play as well</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As work, and know what rest from labor means;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That love of beauty in the heart shall tell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That eyes are never blind to Nature’s scenes.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If <em>Chickamauga</em> means in Cherokee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>A sluggish stream</em>, this dam revives the dead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Electrifies the soul of Tennessee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And gives to industry a potent head.</div>
